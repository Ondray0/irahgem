# Decentralized-Finance-Lending-Application
We need to create an application to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies(Neo/Ether/BTC,etc.) The three important entities in this application are the Lender, Borrower and DeFi lending platform. The lender can deposit money in the platform(which will be some smart contracts) similar to how people deposit money in their banks. The Borrower can deposit crypto assets as collateral and obtain cryptocurrency loans with a specified loan maturity period and interest rate. The borrower first deposits crypto collateral. He receives a specified amount of loan after successful deposit of collateral He makes periodic payments to the platform ,which in turn pay the amount to the lender similar to how banks work. After successful payment of the loan , the borrower gets back his collateral and the lender receives his investment amount with a certain interest.
